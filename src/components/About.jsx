            Traditional insurance typically offers standardized coverage options
            that are designed to meet the needs of a broad range of individuals
            or businesses. Personalized insurance, on the other hand, takes a
            more tailored approach by customizing insurance policies to fit the
            specific needs and preferences of the policyholder. This can include
            adjusting coverage limits, adding or removing coverage options, and
            incorporating unique features based on individual circumstances.
            Personalized insurance aims to provide more targeted and
            comprehensive coverage that better aligns with the policyholder's
            specific requirements and risk profile.
